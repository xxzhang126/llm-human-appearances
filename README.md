## Repository structure

- `code/CV Evaluation test/` – Scripts for the CV evaluation experiment (GPT-4o).
- `code/KS test power analysis/` – Scripts for KS test power analysis.
- `code/Model test/` – Scripts for testing major LLMs capability in processing vision (read gender and attractiveness).
- `code/Results visuals/` – Scripts for visualizing each comparable sets of the results.
- `code/Robustness_Tests/` – Monte Carlo simulations for candidate ranking bias analysis by job type.
- `code/Robustness_Tests/` – Scripts to simulate AI evaluator decisions matched on HR evaluators’ demographic profiles (“AI twin” analysis).
- `raw data/` – Original resume data.
- `results/LLM/` – Summarized results from LLM (GPT-4o) runs.
- `results/KS Power Analysis/` – Summarized results for KS power analysis.
- `results/Model Test/` – Summarized results for testing major LLMs capability in processing vision.

## Computational Pipeline
Data preprocessing, LLM-based experiments, and visualization are conducted in Python.
Statistical analyses and regressions are performed in Stata using analysis-ready datasets
generated by the Python pipeline. The Stata code is provided in `/code/stata/` and follows a sequential execution order.
