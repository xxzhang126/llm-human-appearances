## Repository structure

- `code/CV Evaluation test/` – Scripts for the CV evaluation experiment (GPT-4o).
- `code/KS test power analysis/` – Scripts for KS test power analysis.
- `code/Model test/` – Scripts for testing major LLMs capability in processing vision (read gender and attractiveness).
- `code/Results visuals/` – Scripts for visualizing each comparable sets of the results.
- `code/Robustness Tests/` – Robustness test scripts combining Monte Carlo simulations for job-type candidate ranking bias and AI evaluator decision simulations matched to HR evaluators’ demographic profiles.

## Computational Pipeline
Data preprocessing, LLM-based experiments, and visualization are conducted in Python.
Statistical analyses and regressions are performed in Stata using analysis-ready datasets
generated by the Python pipeline. The Stata code is provided in `/code/stata/` and follows a sequential execution order.
